          <h1><b>Result Structure</b></h1>
            <p>The best way to quickly understand results returned by the Marvel Comics API is to test actual calls using the <b>interactive documentation</b>. The documentation presented here provides a deeper dive into API result structure and organization.</p>

            <h2><b>Results</b></h2>
              <p>Results returned by the API endpoints have the same general format, no matter which entity type the endpoint returns. Every successful call will return a <b>wrapper</b> object, which contains metadata about the call and a <b>container</b> object, which displays pagination information and an array of the results returned by this call. This pattern is consistent even if you are requesting a single object.</p>
              <p>Wrappers for successful calls have the following format:</p>
              <div>
              <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
                <tr class="danger">

                </tr>
                <tr>

              </div>

              <p>Containers have this format:</p>

              </table>

            <h2><b>Errors</b></h2>
            <p>If a call to an API endpoint fails, the API will return an error object with the following format:</p>
              <div>
              <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
                <tr class="danger">
                  <th><b>attribure</b></th>
                  <th><b>type</b></th>
                  <th><b>discription</b></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>code</td>
                  <td>int</td>
                  <td>the http status code of the error</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                  <td>int</td>
                  <td>a description of the error</td>
              </table>
              </div>
            <p>The API will also send an HTTP status code equal to the code attribute of the returned error object.</p>

          <h1><b>Entity types and representations</b></h1>
              <p>In addition to telling epic stories of misunderstood teenagers swinging between the skyscrapers of Manhattan, comics have a robust and complex data model and consist of several different entity types. Before we get into the specifics of the API results we'll explain what these entities are and how they relate to each other.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Comic issues (or just <b>comics</b>) are the physical or digital products that end-users read. (The Marvel Comics API returns comic issues, collections, graphic novels and digital comics as part of the overall comics endpoint and entity type.)</li>
                <li>Comics belong to a <b>series</b>, which is a (usually) sequentially number list of comics with the same title and volume. Marvel uses the year of original publication for a series as the volume number.</li>
                <li>Comics can also be a part of an <b>event</b>, which is a big, universe-changing storyline. A comic's appearance in an event is often independent of its membership in a series.</li>
                <li>Comics are made up of <b>stories</b>, which are indivisible components of comics. Most comics have two stories - a cover and an interior story - but many, such as anthology comics and collections, will have more. Stories may be re-published in several comics, but the comic in which they originally appeared will always be present as a data point.</li>
                <li><b>Creators</b> are the people and entities that make comics. They are assigned to the specific comic stories on which they worked, but we bubble up those assignments to the issues, series and events in which the stories appear as a convenience.</li>
                <li><b>Characters</b> are people and organizations which appear in comics. They are also assigned to stories initially and bubbled up to issues, series and events.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>(If you are interested in comics data structures and making comics more accessible generally, join Marvel in participating in the proposal process for <b>schema.org</b> and <b>Biblex</b> extensions for web schemas.)</p>
              
              <h2><b>Entity Representations</b></h2>
                <p>Entities returned by the API will have two representations: a full view and a summary view. The full view is returned by requests to a resource endpoint, and summaries are returned when a resource is referenced by a full resource. For example, a call to the comics endpoint <b><a href="http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics">http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/comics</a></b> returns full views of comics and summaries of other entities such as creators which created the comic, characters which appear in it and the series in which the comic belongs.</p>
                <p>We will explain the full representations of entities more in-depth below - they will vary from entity type to entity type.</p>
                <p>Summary views will always contain a resourceURI, which points to the full representation of the referenced entity, and a name, for convenience. Some summary representations will additionally have a field describing its type or the relationship between the returned entity and the referenced entity.</p>
                <p>You can expect that any result returned by an endpoint to have a full set of fields, but some fields may have empty values. For example, a string attribute may return an empty string or null, but the field will always be present in the returned representation.</p>
                <p>Full schemas for each endpoint are also available in the interactive documentation.</p>

              <h2><b>Common structures</b></h2>
                <p>While each entity type returned by an endpoint has a distinct structure, many will have components which have a common structure.</p>
                <h3><b>URLs</b></h3>
                  <p>URLs are references to web pages or deep links into applications. (When present in a resultset, it is preferred that you use these to link back to Marvel.) Many resources will have more than one representation on the web so URLs are generally presented as an array of URL resources. URLs are modeled as follows:</p>
                  <div>
                  <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
                    <tr class="danger">
                      <th><b>attribure</b></th>
                      <th><b>type</b></th>
                      <th><b>discription</b></th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>type</td>
                      <td>string</td>
                      <td>A text identifier for the URL.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>url</td>
                      <td>string</td>
                      <td>A full URL (including scheme, domain, and path).</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  </div>

                <h3><b>Text Objects</b></h3>
                  <p>Text objects are bits of descriptive text which are attached to an entity. They have the following properties:</p>
                  <div>
                  <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
                    <tr class="danger">
                      <th><b>attribure</b></th>
                      <th><b>type</b></th>
                      <th><b>discription</b></th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>type</td>
                      <td>string</td>
                      <td>The string description of the text object (e.g. solicit text, preview text, etc.).</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>language</td>
                      <td>string</td>
                      <td>A language code denoting which language the text object is written in.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>text</td>
                      <td>string</td>
                      <td>The text of the text object.</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  </div>

                <h3><b>Resources URIs</b></h3>
                  <p>Resource URIs are references to the representation of a resource within the API. Every resource and resource summary will have a resource URI attribute.</p>

                <h3><b>Resources Lists</b></h3>
                  <p>Resource lists are collections of summary views within the context of another entity type. For example, the list of creators attached to a comic would be presented as resource list inside the full representation of that comic. Resource lists have the following format:</p>
                  <div>
                  <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
                    <tr class="danger">
                      <th><b>attribure</b></th>
                      <th><b>type</b></th>
                      <th><b>discription</b></th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td><b>available</b></td>
                      <td>int</td>
                      <td>The number of total available resources in this list</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>returned</td>
                      <td>int</td>
                      <td>The number of resources returned in this resource list (up to 20).</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>collectionURI</td>
                      <td>string</td>
                      <td>The path to the list of full view representations of the items in this resource list.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>items</td>
                      <td>Array[entity summary representations]</td>
                      <td>A list of summary views of the items in this resource list.</td>
                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  </div>
                  <p>Requests to the collectionURI will return full representations of the entities in the resource list. For example, the uri <b><a href="http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/32">http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/32</a></b> will return a representation of a particular creator. That creator representation will have an issues attribute which is a resource list of issues that he or she worked on. A call to the resource list's collection URI <b><a href="http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/32/comics">http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/creators/32/comics</a></b> will return a set of full representations of comics, filtered by the creator with id of 32.</p>

                <h3><b>Images</b></h3>
                  <p>Images are represented as a partial path and an extension. See the guide to images for information about how to construct full paths to image files.</p>
